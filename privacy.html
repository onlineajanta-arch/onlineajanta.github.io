    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> February 2025</p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        The Amazon Marker App is a private automation tool used to process Amazon order data,
        extract customization details, and upload relevant information (such as product logos)
        to the user's Google Drive and Google Sheets.
        This application is used solely by the owner of the Google account that authorizes it.
    </p>

    <h2>Information We Access</h2>
    <p>
        The application requires limited access to Google APIs in order to function.
        Specifically, it uses the following permissions:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Google Drive (drive.file):</strong>
            Allows the app to upload and manage only the files that the app itself creates
            inside the user’s Google Drive.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Google Sheets (spreadsheets):</strong>
            Allows the app to read and update values inside the specific Google Sheet
            used for Amazon order processing.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>
        Data accessed by the application is used exclusively to:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Upload logo images into the user’s Google Drive folder</li>
        <li>Insert logo URLs and customization data into the user’s Google Sheet</li>
        <li>Keep order and customization records organized</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Storage</h2>
    <p>
        The application does not store any user data externally.
        All data remains fully inside the user's own Google Drive and Google Sheets.
        No information is transmitted to any external servers or third-party services.
    </p>

    <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>
        We do not share, sell, or distribute any user data.
        The application is used only by the single authorized Google account owner.
    </p>

    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>
        The application uses OAuth 2.0 and Google’s secure authentication
        to ensure safe access to Drive and Sheets resources.
        No passwords are collected or stored.
    </p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>
        This privacy policy may be updated if required by Google or by changes in the application.
        The updated version will always be available on this page.
    </p>
